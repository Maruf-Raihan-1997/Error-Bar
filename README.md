# Error Bar
CI, SE, SD

Error bars are small lines on a graph that show how uncertain or variable your measurements are.
They don’t just show the mean — they give a visual hint about how spread out the data is or how confident you are in the value.

SD (Standard Deviation)
How spread out the data is around the mean.

SE (Standard Error)
How much the sample mean is likely to vary from the true population mean.

CI (Confidence Interval)
A range where you expect the true mean to be with a given probability (e.g., 95%).
